## Application Requirements

* Split the Book results into two rows, first row should be titles starting with A-M and the second row should be titles starting with N-Z.
* Include a way to hide/show results if more than 5.
* Display the Book Images at one standard size.
* Must be responsive (desktop, mobile).
* Add as many bonuses as possible.

# Bonuses

## Design
* Besides the key concepts, feel free to add your own style, while keeping it inline with the original wireframe.

## JavaScript framework
* Choose a JavaScript framework such as React, Vue, Angular, etc.

## Modal
* If you click on an image, show a modal that displays a bigger version of the picture with its metadata.

## Filter
* Add a text field that allows a user to filter results on title or ISBN and reduces the results shown (show more would go away if search results are over 5).
